UOM TEXTBOOK TRADING APPLICATION VISION STATEMENT

The UoM Textbook Trading Application (UTTA) will be used to trade textbooks between users. The application will be available on Google Play Store or as .apk file and will be able to do a book search and buy, view buyer/seller profile, etc... as users wish.

UTTA will feature the ability to post the user’s book(s) up for sale along with the photo(s) and prices for each book. Users, as a seller, have the option to tag the course in which the book belongs to (or “none” for book outside of any courses) and to put the book in one or more categorize available: English, Math, Chemistry,... As a buyer, users can make searches for the book they are looking for using the filter like the book’s name, course, subjects and see all the available books along with prices. In case there is no result from the search, buyers are able to choose to get a notification when the desired book is available (or not). 

Users can create a chat which each other (which is private) to discuss topics their desire, and can “add friend”  to their friend list for further contact. Each item the user is interested in and viewed will be saved as a search history for convenience. It is the user’s responsibility to mark a post as “sold” when another user bought the item or it is unavailable.

UTTA will focus on students as its main users, as well as instructors or TA in the Univesity of Manitoba campus. For all users, this application will make searching and buying/selling books easier as it is more “book trading-oriented” and more locality than other online trading websites and features such as Amazon or Facebook Market. Better locality leads to more accuracy in searching as most of the required books for courses will be closed to the user (in this case is UofM campus).

Current available online e-commerce (supported) companies like Amazon and Facebook have a lot of unnecessary distractions when the users determine to buy/sell books only, so UTTA offers a better focus. Also when it comes to the locality, UTTA gives more accuracy since books posted on UTTA come with course tags like COMP3350, BIOL1000 or MATH1240. These help users to locate down they wanted book(s) with the correct version, language, author and edition since it is sold by people who had that course. 

UTTA will be considered a success base on these criteria. First, the number of conversations initiated each month between users will be considered since it has a direct ratio with the number of the actual completed transactions. Second, the number of users each month with constant growth is another sign of success. Lastly, since sellers will be asked to rate their experience after each post removal, the average rating of them will be summarized at the end of each month. If any one of these criteria show a significant improvement, without a statistically‐significant reduction    in the other two, the application will be considered a success
